### "unscrupulous flirt"

- Flirt (和...)调情;(和...)打情骂俏
  If you flirt with someone, you behave as if you are sexually attracted to them, in a playful or not very serious way.[V with n]


e g. He flirts outrageously with all the ladies.

- Flirtation
- 和一名学生打情骂俏的教授
    a professor who has a flirtation with a student    

- 她知道他想要挑逗她

    she was aware of his attempts to flirt with her.
    
- 不认真地考虑;有...的念头(或想法);

- If you don't take a love affair seriously, it's not fun. If you do, it breaks your heart. Don't break your heart, but flirt with the possibility.

- unscrupulous

 If you describe a person as unscrupulous, you are criticall of the fact that they are prepared to act in dishonest or immoral way in order to get what they want.
 
 Mitchell was, in her own words, an "unscrupulous flirt". She found herself engaged to five men, but maintained that she neither lied to or misled any of them.
 
 A local gossip columnist, described Mitchell's love life in a 1922 coulumn:
    "...she has in her brief life, perhaps, had more men really" truly 'dead in love' with her, more honest-to-goodness suitors than almost any other girl in Atlanta."
    
Scarlett was used to men asking her to marry them, men much more attractive than Charles Hamilton, and men who had more finesse than to propose at a barbecue when she had more important matters on her mind. She only saw a boy of twenty, red as a beet and he looking very silly. She wished that she could tell him how silly he looked.
    
But automatically, the words Ellen had taught her to say In such emergencies rose to her lips and casting down her eyes, from force of long habit, she murmured:" Mr. Hamilton, I am not unaware of the honor you have bestowed on me in wating me to become your wife, but this is all so suddent that I do not know what to say."
    
That was a neat way of smoothing a man's vanity and yet keeping him on the string, and Charles rose to it as though such bait were new and he the first to swallow it.

She was undoubtedly the belle of the barbecue, the center of attention. The furore she was causing among the men, coupled with teh heart burning s of the other girls, would have pleased her enormously at any other time.

    When I started loving myself

    As I began to love myself

    I found that anguish and emotional suffering are only warning signs that I was living against my own truth.

    Today, I know,This is "AUTHENTICITY".

    As I began to love myself

    I understood how much it can offend somebody as I try to force my desires on this person, 

    even though i knew the time was not right and the person was not ready for it,
    and even though this person was me.
    Today I call it "RESPECT".

    As I began to love myself

    I stopped craving for a different life,

    and i could see that everything that surrounded me was inviting me to grow.

    Today I call it "MATURITY"

    As I bengan to lvoe myself

    I understand that at any circumstance,

    I am in the right place at the right time,
    and everything happens at the exactly right momnet,

    so I could be calm.
    
    Today I call it "SELF-CONFIDENCE".

    As I began to lvoe myself

    I quit steeling my own time,

    and I stopped designing huge projects for the future.

    Today,I only do what brings me joy and happiness,
    things I love to do and that make my heart cheer,

    and I do them in my own way
    and in my own rhythm.
    Today I call it "HONESTY"

    As i began to love myself

    I freed myself of anything that is no good for my health

    food,people,things,situations,

    and everything that drew me down and away from myself.

    At first I called this attitude a healthy egoism.

    Today i know it is "Love of ONESELF"

    As i began to love myself

    I quit trying to always be right,

    and ever since I was wrong less of the time.

    Today I discovered that is "MODESTY".

    As I began to love myself

    I refused to go on living in the past

    and worry about the future.

    Now, I only live for the moment,

    where EVERYTHING is happening.

    Today I live each day, day by day.

    and iI call it "PERFECTION".

    As I began to lvoe myself

    I recognized that my mind can disturb me and it can make me sick.

    But as I connected it to my heart,

    my mind became a valuable ally.

    Today I call this connection WISDOM OF THE HEART.

    We no longer need to fear arguments,

    confrontations or any kind of problems with ourselves or others.

    Even stars collide,

    and out of their crashing new worlds are born.

    Today I know That is LIFE.

But it was an arresting face, pointed of chin, square of jaw. Her eyes were pale green without a touch of hazel, Starred with bristly black lashes and slightly tilted at the ends. Above them, her thcik black brows slanted upward, cutting a startling oblique line in her magnolia-white skin-that skin so prized by Sourthern women and so carefully guarded with bonnets, veils and mittens against ho Georgia suns.

五官面容词汇及其修饰形容词

Seated with Stuart and Brent Tarleton in the coll shade of the porch of Tara, her father's platation, that bright April afternoon of 1861, she made a pretty picture. Her new green flowered-muslin dress spread its twelve yards of billowing material over her hopps and exactly matched the flat-heeled green morocco slippers her father had recently brought her from Atlanta.

Muslin:平纹细布

billow:布制品鼓起,烟或云翻滚,滚滚而上


When something made of cloth billows, it swells out and moves slowly in the wind.

The world is full of human lobsters; men stranded on the rocks of indecision and procrastination,who, instead of putting forth their own energies, are waiting for some grand billow of good fortuen to set them afloat.

- Strand:滞留,搁浅.

 - 时尚不会让你变得性感,你的经历和想象力才能让你变得性感.而要想得到这些性感没有别的捷径,唯一的方法就是你得好好生活.

 - 这世界越来越糟,年轻人越发轻浮,中产阶级变得无趣.年轻人失去了活力,失去了梦想,失去了执着.青春还没结束,他们已经在庸庸碌碌,死气沉着中活着了.所有精神上的追求在他们看起来还不如一只包,所有人都用国际大品牌来武装自己,并嘲笑穷人和长者.

 - "自己"这个东西平时一向是看不见的,和很强的,水准很高的东西相碰撞,反弹回来,然后才知道"自己"是什么东西.

 The dress set off to perfection the seventeen-inch waist, the smallest in thress counties, and the tightly fitting basques showed breasts well matured for her sixteen years.But for all the modesty of her spreading skirts, the demureness of hair netted smoothly into a chignon and the quietness of small white hands folded in her lap, her true self was poorly concealed.

- demure:端庄娴静的

Every man's work, wherher it be literature or music or pictures or architecture or anything else, is always a protrait of himself, and the more he tries to conceal himself the more clearly will his character appear.

It is the false shame of folls to try to conceal wounds what have not healed.

每个人都有一段悲伤,想隐藏却欲盖弥彰.

有些人变了,要么是因为隐藏了一部分,要么是因为只展露了一部分.而无论选择隐藏还是展露,那变化了的一部分都并不是凭空消失或者多出来的,它一直都在你身上,一直都在.

The green eyes in the carefully sweet face were turbulent,willful,lusty with life, distinctly at variance with her decorous demeanor. Her manners had been imposed upon her by her mother's gentle admonitions and the sterner discipline of her mammy; her eyes were her own.

decorous 端庄稳重的

admonition 告诫,劝告

Although initially she tries to behave prettily, her Instincts rise up against social restrictions. Determination defines Scarlett and drives her to achieve everything she desires by any means necessary.

- "If you'll promise, we'll tell you a secret," said Stuart.
- "What?" cried Scarlett, alert as a child at the word.
- "Is it what we heard yesterday in Atlanta, Stu? Iif it is, you know we promised not to tell."

- "Well, Miss Pitty told us."
- "Miss Who?"
- "You know, Ashley Wilkes" cousin who lives in Atlanta, Miss Pittypat Hamilton -- Charles and Melanie Hamilton's aunt."
"I do, and a sillier old lady I never met in all my life."

- "Well, when we were in Atlanta yesterday, waitng for the home train, her carriage went by the depot and she stopped and talked to us, and she told us there was going to be an engagement announced tomorrow night at the Wilkes ball."


- "Oh,I know about that," said Scarlett in disappointmnet. "That silly nephew of hers, Charlie Hamilton, and Honey Wilkes. Everybody's know for years that they'd get married some time, even if he did seem kind of lukewarm about it."

- "Do you think he's silly?" questioned Brent. "Last Christmas you sure let him buzz round you plenty."

- "I couldn't help him buzzing," Scarlett shrugged negligently."I think he's an awful sissy."

- "Besides, it isn't his engagement that's going to be announced," said Stuart triumphantly. "It's Ashley's to Charlie's sister, Miss Melanie!"

- Scarlett's face did not change but her lips went white -- like a person who has received a stunning blow without warning and who, int hte first moments of shock, does not realize what has happened. So still was her face as she stared at Stuart that he, never analytic, took it for granted that she was merely suprised and very interested.

- Filled with new enthusiasm by their success, they lingered on, talking about the barbecue and the ball and Ashley Wilkes and Melanie Hamilton, interrupting each other, making jokes and laughing at them, hinting broadly for invitations to supper. Some time had passed before they realized that Scarlett was having very little to say.
