Mammy felt that she owned the O'Haras, body and soul, that their secrets were her secrets; and even a hint of a mystery was enough to set her upon the trail as relentlessly as a bloodhound.

- Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail.                 
                                                    ---- Ralph Waldo Emerson

# 关于好奇心

- 一个人成长的最大能源,就是好奇心.
                        - - 东野奎吾

- 好奇心是人最宝贵的东西,这是思想的出发点,没有好奇心,也就没有想弄清事物的愿望.好奇心往往与人的能力有关,如果一件事物超出某人的能力,那么这件事物就不能引起他的好奇心.所以,能力是好奇心的界限.-- 石康

- 人越是不了解自己,他对外面的世界就越是有好奇心.好奇心是一种逃避,它是我们对自己本质无知的最大逃避.  --- 张方宇 <单独中的洞见>

### Plausible:貌似合理的

- That explanation seems entirely plausible to me.

 接受事实 调试心态

- Turth is hard to tell, it sometimes need fiction to make it plausible.  
            --Francis Bacon


- Scarlett heard the stairs groan and she got softly to her feet. When Mammy returned she would resume her lecture on Scarlett's breach of hospitality, and Scarlett felt that she could not endure prating about such a trivial matter when her heart was breaking.

- Six mistakes mankind keeps making century after century:
    1. Believing that personal gain is made by crushing others; 
    2. worrying about things that cannot be changed or corrected;
    3. insisting that a thing is impossible because we cannot accomplish;
    4. refusing to set aside trivial preferences;
    5. neglecting development and refinement of the mind;
    6. attempting to compel others to believe and live as we do.
- Our souls may lose their peace and even disturb other people's, if we are always criticizing trivial actions ---- which often are not real defects at all, but we construe them wrongly through our ignorance of their motives.

- It seemed strange now that when she was growing up Ashley had never semmed so very attractive to her. In childhood days, she had seen him come and go and never given him a thought.

- But since that day two years ago when Ashley, newly home from his three years'Grand Tour in Europe, had called to pay his respects,she had loved him. It was as simple as that.

- She had been on the front porch and he had ridden up the long avenue, dressed in gray broadcloth with a wide black cravat setting off his frilled shirt to perfection.

- Even now, she could recall each detail of his dress, how brightly his boots shone, the head of a Medusa in cameo on his cravat phi,the wide Panama hat that was instantly in his hand when he saw her.

- Your memory is a monster;you forget,it doesn't. It simply flies things away. It keeps things for you,or hide things from you ---- and summons them to your recall with a will of its own.You think you have a memory;but it has you.

- He had alighted and tossed his bridle reins to a pickaninny and stood looking up at her, his drowsy gray eyes wide with a smile and the sun so bright on his blond hair that it seemed like a cpa of shining silver.

- And he said,"So you've grown up,Scarlett." And, coming lightly up the steps, he had kissed her hand. And his voice!SAhe would never forget the leap of her heart as she heard it, as if for the first time, drawling, resonatn, musical.

- She had wanted him, int that first instant, wanted him as simply and unreasoningly as she wanted fodd to eat, horses to ride and a soft bed on which to lay herself.

- For two years he had squired her about the County, to balls, fish fries, picnics and court days, nver so often as the Tarleton twins or Cade Calvert, never so importunate as the younger Fontaine boys, but, still, never the week went by that Ashley did not come caling at Tara.

- 碰到好的欢喜的东西, 总是要留得一份清单余地, 才会有中正的情缘. 有时会故意的若即若离.因极希望它存在并且长久.所以,不容许自己沉溺,一直以来就是如此克制. 安妮宝贝<二三事>

- 可进可出,若即若离,可爱可怨,可聚而不会散,才是最天长地久的一种好朋友. -- 三毛

- True, he never made love to her, nor did the clear gray eyes ever glow with that hot light Scarlett knew so well in other men. And yet -- and yet -- she knew he loved her. She could not be mistaken about it. Instinct stronger than reason and knowledge born of experience told her that he loved her.
