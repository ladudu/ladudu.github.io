Mammy felt that she owned the O'Haras, body and soul, that their secrets were her secrets; and even a hint of a mystery was enough to set her upon the trail as relentlessly as a bloodhound.

- Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail.                 
                                                    ---- Ralph Waldo Emerson

# 关于好奇心

- 一个人成长的最大能源,就是好奇心.
                        - - 东野奎吾

- 好奇心是人最宝贵的东西,这是思想的出发点,没有好奇心,也就没有想弄清事物的愿望.好奇心往往与人的能力有关,如果一件事物超出某人的能力,那么这件事物就不能引起他的好奇心.所以,能力是好奇心的界限.-- 石康

- 人越是不了解自己,他对外面的世界就越是有好奇心.好奇心是一种逃避,它是我们对自己本质无知的最大逃避.  --- 张方宇 <单独中的洞见>

### Plausible:貌似合理的

- That explanation seems entirely plausible to me.

 接受事实 调试心态

- Turth is hard to tell, it sometimes need fiction to make it plausible.  
            --Francis Bacon


- Scarlett heard the stairs groan and she got softly to her feet. When Mammy returned she would resume her lecture on Scarlett's breach of hospitality, and Scarlett felt that she could not endure prating about such a trivial matter when her heart was breaking.

- Six mistakes mankind keeps making century after century:
    1. Believing that personal gain is made by crushing others; 
    2. worrying about things that cannot be changed or corrected;
    3. insisting that a thing is impossible because we cannot accomplish;
    4. refusing to set aside trivial preferences;
    5. neglecting development and refinement of the mind;
    6. attempting to compel others to believe and live as we do.
- Our souls may lose their peace and even disturb other people's, if we are always criticizing trivial actions ---- which often are not real defects at all, but we construe them wrongly through our ignorance of their motives.

- It seemed strange now that when she was growing up Ashley had never semmed so very attractive to her. In childhood days, she had seen him come and go and never given him a thought.

- But since that day two years ago when Ashley, newly home from his three years'Grand Tour in Europe, had called to pay his respects,she had loved him. It was as simple as that.

- She had been on the front porch and he had ridden up the long avenue, dressed in gray broadcloth with a wide black cravat setting off his frilled shirt to perfection.

- Even now, she could recall each detail of his dress, how brightly his boots shone, the head of a Medusa in cameo on his cravat phi,the wide Panama hat that was instantly in his hand when he saw her.

- Your memory is a monster;you forget,it doesn't. It simply flies things away. It keeps things for you,or hide things from you ---- and summons them to your recall with a will of its own.You think you have a memory;but it has you.

- He had alighted and tossed his bridle reins to a pickaninny and stood looking up at her, his drowsy gray eyes wide with a smile and the sun so bright on his blond hair that it seemed like a cpa of shining silver.

- And he said,"So you've grown up,Scarlett." And, coming lightly up the steps, he had kissed her hand. And his voice!SAhe would never forget the leap of her heart as she heard it, as if for the first time, drawling, resonatn, musical.

- She had wanted him, int that first instant, wanted him as simply and unreasoningly as she wanted fodd to eat, horses to ride and a soft bed on which to lay herself.

- For two years he had squired her about the County, to balls, fish fries, picnics and court days, nver so often as the Tarleton twins or Cade Calvert, never so importunate as the younger Fontaine boys, but, still, never the week went by that Ashley did not come caling at Tara.

- 碰到好的欢喜的东西, 总是要留得一份清单余地, 才会有中正的情缘. 有时会故意的若即若离.因极希望它存在并且长久.所以,不容许自己沉溺,一直以来就是如此克制. 安妮宝贝<二三事>

- 可进可出,若即若离,可爱可怨,可聚而不会散,才是最天长地久的一种好朋友. -- 三毛

- True, he never made love to her, nor did the clear gray eyes ever glow with that hot light Scarlett knew so well in other men. And yet -- and yet -- she knew he loved her. She could not be mistaken about it. Instinct stronger than reason and knowledge born of experience told her that he loved her.

- Too often she had surprised him when his eyes were neither drowsy nor remote,when he lookeed at her with a yearning and a sadness which puzzled her. She knew he loved her. Whty did he not tell her so? That she could not understand. But there were so many things about him that she did not understand.

- He was courteous always, but aloof, remote. No one could ever tell what he was thingking about, Scarlett least of all. In a neighborhood where everyone said exactly what he thought as soon as he thought it, Ashley's quality of reserve was exasperating.

### aloof
    Someone who is aloof is not very friendly and does not like to spend time with other people.

- 冷漠离群

aloof

remote

detached 

impersonal

unresponsive 没有反应的

unapproachable

 He seemed aloof and detached.

Idealism detached from action is just a dream. But idealism allied with pragmatism, with rolling up your sleeves and making the world bend a bit, is very exciting. It's very real. It's very strong.

Life is a tide; float on it. Go down with it and go up with it, but be detached. Then it is not difficult.

Behind all their personal vanity, women themselves always have an impersonal contempt for woman.

真正的轻视与真正的高傲正好相反,真正的轻视藏在心中,不让别人知道它的存在.如果你希望他知道自己如何把它看低的话,便不是轻视,而是憎恨了. ---- 叔本华

一件事对你伤寒的程度与事情本身没有太多关系,你受伤的程度取决于你对这件事的态度.重视就重伤,轻视就轻伤,无视就无伤.



- He was as proficient as any of the other young men in the usual County diversions, hunting,gambling,dancing and politics, and was the best rider of them all; but he differed from all the rest in that these pleasant activities were not the end and aim of life to him. And he stood alone in his interest in books and music and his fondness ofr writing poetry.

- Oh, why was he so <font color=#D2691E>handsomely blond, so courteously aloof,</font> so maddeningly boring with his talk about Europe and books and music and poetry and things that interested her not at all -- and yet so desirable?

But the next time came and went, and the reslt was nothing -- nothing except that the fever possessing her rose higher and hotter.

Unrefined and refined

- Gerald was a small man, little more than five feet tall, but so heavy of barrel and thick of neck that his appearance, when seated, led strangers to think him a larger man. His thickset torso was supported by shourt sturdy legs, always incased in the finest leather boots procurable and always planted wide apart like a swaggering small boy's.

- He was sixty years old and his crisp curly hair was silver-white, but his shrewd face was unined and his hard little blue eyes were young with the unworried youthfulness of one who has never taxed his brain with problems more abstract than how many cards to draw in a poker game.
